# pass-all
Print all passwords in your password-store, for making a hardcopy

Use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)? Here's a shell script that prints
out every password in your store in a compact format, making it easy to
generate a hard copy.

`pass-all` works best with a two-level hierarchy, for example if you name your
passwords like `Internet/google`, `Shopping/amazon`, `Social/facebook`
